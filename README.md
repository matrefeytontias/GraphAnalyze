### Building on Windows

Download MSYS2 from the official website ; when that's done, install `gcc` and `make`.
Go in the top-level folder and run `make` to compile or `make run` to compile and run.
Easy like that.

### Building on Linux

Install the package `libglfw3-dev`, and run `make` to compile or `make run` to
compile and run. Even easier !
